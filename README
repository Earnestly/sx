INTRODUCTION

  sx is a simple alternative to both xinit(1) and startx(1) for starting
  an Xorg server.

  It started life as a proof of concept while attempting to learn how both
  xinit and startx worked.

  It is not a direct replacement however as it provides a different, more
  limited, interface.

  Some of these major differences are listed here:

    * The server's command-line is hard coded and not exposed to the
      user.
    * The server starts on the same tty the user logged in on.
    * The server doesn't listen on anything except unix domain sockets.
    * The first DISPLAY is 1 instead of 0 contrary to what X(7) suggests.
    * xauth entries are overwritten if the displayname is identical.
    * Corresponding xauth entries are unconditionally removed when the server
      exits.
    * The server uses the -noreset flag.
    * While XAUTHORITY is still honoured, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sx/xauthfile is
      used instead of $HOME/.Xauthority
    * Very little proxy error checking is used preferring instead to let each
      tool speak for itself.
    * None of the typical /etc/X11/xinit infrastructure is directly used.
    * Neither XINITRC is honoured nor .xinitrc used.
    * The XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sx/sxrc file is used instead of .xinitrc and is
      required to be executable.

  For a rational on why this exists, the author invites the reader to look
  over the source code for both xinit and startx.

NOTES

  Since the addition of Xorg.wrap it may be necessary to set allowed_users to
  anybody in /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config as sx attempts to start clients from
  within a subshell and is thusly not considered a console user.

REQUIRES

  * Xorg
  * xauth
  * /dev/urandom
